# Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

# 1. Reporting Entity

Advantest Corporation (the “Company”) is a public company located in Japan. The Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements consist of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Advantest”). Advantest manufactures and sells semiconductor and component test system products and mechatronics-related products such as test handlers and device interfaces. Advantest also engages in research and development activities and provides maintenance and support services associated with these products.

# 2. Basis of Preparation

# (1) Compliance with IFRS

As the Company meets the requirements of a “Specified Companies applying Designated IFRS” pursuant to Article 1-2 of the “Ordinance on Terminology, Forms, and Preparation Methods of Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements”, Advantest prepares the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34 under Article 93 of the same ordinance. As the condensed consolidated financial statements do not contain all the information required in annual consolidated financial statements, they should be read in combination with the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The condensed consolidated financial statements were approved on February 13, 2019 by Yoshiaki Yoshida, Representative Director and Atsushi Fujita, Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

# (2) Basis of Measurement

The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets and liabilities measured at their fair values.

# (3) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency

The condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese Yen, which is the Company’s functional currency.

# 3. Significant Accounting Policies

The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the same accounting policies as those applied in the Advantest’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, except for the followings:

# (1) IFRS 9: Financial Instruments

Advantest adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. This new standard is the replacement of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. This standard addresses the classification and measurement (including impairment) of financial instruments and introduces new rules for hedge accounting. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on Advantest consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.

# (1) Classification and measurement of financial instruments

Equity instruments, which were previously classified as available-for-sale under IAS 39, are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and debt instruments are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Advantest chose not to restate its prior period comparatives. Changes in fair value of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized in other comprehensive income and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to retained earnings when the financial assets are derecognized.

### Page 8

# (2) Impairment of financial instruments

Effective from April 1, 2018, Advantest changed the method for measurement of impairment of financial assets from the IAS 39 incurred credit loss model to the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model. Advantest measures a loss allowance based on an expected credit loss model without restatement of prior periods in accordance with the transition requirement of IFRS 9.

# (2) IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Advantest adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. The new standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’.

To apply IFRS 15, Advantest used the cumulative effect transition method which is recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the beginning of the year of initial application.

In accordance with the adoption of IFRS 15, Advantest recognizes revenue based on the five-step model.

1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations (accounting treatment for goods or services separately)
3. Determine the transaction price (amount of consideration)
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
5. Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation

As a result of identifying the contracts with customers and the performance obligations in the contracts and calculating the value of the transactions based on the five-step model indicated above, revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of each performance obligation for those which product and installation are identified as a separate performance obligation compared to the revenue which had been recognized upon installation for the products which require installation based on the previous accounting standard. Consequently, the beginning balance of retained earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 increased (Y) 1,076 million.

Additionally, there is a difference in identifying a performance obligation for services in accordance with the new standard compared with the previous accounting standard. As a result, the beginning balance of retained earnings for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 decreased (Y) 288 million.

As a result of adopting IFRS 15, trade and other receivables, inventories and other current liabilities increased by (Y) 706 million, (Y) 353 million and (Y) 1,119 million, respectively, and deferred tax assets and retained earnings decreased by (Y) 329 million and (Y) 392 million, respectively in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, net sales, operating income and net income decreased by (Y) 3,056 million, (Y) 1,455 million and (Y) 1,220 million, respectively in the condensed consolidated statement of profit or loss for the nine months ended December 31, 2018.

# 4. Significant Accounting Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements requires Advantest to make judgments, accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best judgment of management in light of historical experience and various factors deemed to be reasonable according to the situation. However, given their nature, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are continuously reviewed. The effects of a change in these estimates and assumptions are recognized in the period of the change and subsequent periods.

The estimates and assumptions that could have a material effect on the amounts recognized in its condensed consolidated financial statements are equivalent to those estimates and assumptions in Advantest’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

# 5. Segment Information

# (1) Overview of Reporting Segments

Advantest manufactures and sells semiconductor and component test system products and mechatronics-related products such as test handlers and device interfaces. Advantest also engages in research and development activities and provides maintenance and support services associated with these products. Advantest’s organizational structure consists of three reportable operating segments, which are the design, manufacturing, and sale of semiconductor and component test systems, mechatronics systems and services, support and others. These reportable operating segments are determined based on the nature of the products and the markets. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes.

The semiconductor and component test system segment provides customers with test system products for the semiconductor industry and the electronic parts industry. Product lines provided in the semiconductor and component test system segment include test systems for SoC semiconductor devices and test systems for memory semiconductor devices.

The mechatronics system segment provides product lines such as test handlers, mechatronic-applied products, for handling semiconductor devices, device interfaces that serve as interfaces with the devices that are measured and operations related to nano-technology products.

The services, support and others segment consists of comprehensive customer solutions provided in connection with the above segments, test solutions of system level testing for such as SSD, support services, sales of used products, equipment lease business and others.

# (2) Information of Reporting Segments

Accounting treatment applied to operating segments is the same as in the note “3. Significant Accounting Policies.”

Advantest uses the operating income (loss) before share-based compensation expense for management's analysis of operating segment results.

Share-based compensation expense represents expenses for stock options and performance-based stock remuneration expense.

Segment income (loss) is presented on the basis of operating income (loss) before share-based compensation expense.

Inter-segment sales are based on market prices.

### Page 12

Advantest adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 as described in “3. Significant Accounting Policies”. Since the cumulative effect of the initial adoption is recognized as adjustment of retained earnings at the beginning of the first quarter according to the traditional option, the amount for the third quarter (nine months and three months) ended December 31, 2017 is not restated.

# 6. Bonds

Due to the conversion of Zero Coupon Convertible Bonds due 2019, convertible bonds decreased by (Y) 23,984 million and 14,819,980 shares of treasury shares were reissued during the nine months ended December 31, 2018. As a result, retained earnings, share premium and treasury shares decreased by (Y) 31,453 million, (Y) 576 million and (Y) 56,079 million, respectively.

# 7. Post-Employment Benefits

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit corporate pension plan covering substantially all employees. The Company shifted a part of defined benefit corporate pension plan to defined contribution plan on October 1, 2018. The shift resulted in the gain on the revision of post-employment benefits plan during three months ended December 31, 2018.

The assets will be transitioned for four years. The assets to be transitioned are included in trade and other payables and other non-current liabilities, respectively in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position.
