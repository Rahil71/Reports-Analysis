# Outlook

India’s domestic economic activity has remained resilient with manufacturing activity continuing to gain ground on the back of strengthening domestic demand. The service sector maintained its buoyancy as evident from available high frequency indicators. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, is recovering, with steady discretionary spending in urban areas. Revival in rural demand is getting a fillip from improving farm sector activity. With an expected above normal south-west monsoon, kharif production is likely to get a boost and reservoir levels likely to be replenished which were running low due to extreme heat. Inflation, however, continues to require close monitoring by the policy makers.

With the Union Elections behind and the likely political stability, the Government’s continued thrust on capex and business optimism augur well for investment activity. However, the pace of infrastructure progress could slow down due to skilled labour shortage in certain sectors. The Indian economy is at an inflection point in its path towards greater transformational changes that will bring about more stability and growth.

The global economy is expected to witness a rebound, though the run-up to the US Presidential elections in November can exhibit economic volatility. With the change of Government in UK, and a hung parliament in France, the concern about the European economic recovery remains. China’s economic recovery remains debatable with rising trade tensions threatening to overshadow growth in exports.

Central banks in the West are closely tracking inflation data and may announce a couple of rate cuts later in 2024. Further, regional conflicts remain contained as of now without having

major adverse implications for the global economy. The countries in the Middle East remain focused on investments in Oil & Gas, Infrastructure, Industrialisation and Energy transition. However, headwinds continue to linger around geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility.

The Company retains the focus on profitable execution of its robust order book in the backdrop of a relatively stable environment. It is well positioned to exploit the emerging opportunities across the diversified business portfolio and limit exposure on non-core businesses. The Company remains committed to maximizing sustainable value to all its stakeholders.
