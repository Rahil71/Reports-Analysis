# 1.2.5

Vide notification dated 30.10.2023, Section 5 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020 [CAA-2020] has been commenced. Section 5 of the CAA-2020 provides for an amendment in Section 23 of the Companies Act, 2013 for allowing direct listing of equity shares of Indian public companies in permissible foreign jurisdictions.

The Companies (Listing of equity shares in permissible jurisdictions) Rules, 2024 have been issued vide notification dated 24.01.2024.

# CHAPTER – IV

# THE LIMITED LIABILITY PARTNERSHIP (LLP) ACT, 2008

# 4.1.1

The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of Indian economy since long back and, traditionally, the micro and small segments are dominated by proprietary and partnership concerns. But, the functioning of a proprietorship or a partnership firm is too opaque, making assessment of creditworthiness by bankers difficult and therefore the MSME sector is at a comparative disadvantage vis-à-vis corporate bodies in accessing loan/credit facilities from banks and other financial institutions.

# 4.1.2

In this backdrop, a need was felt for a new corporate form that would provide an alternative to the traditional partnership with unlimited personal liability. The statute-based governance structure of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is an alternative that enables professional expertise and entrepreneurial initiative to combine, organise, and operate in a flexible, innovative, and efficient manner. Internationally, these are the preferred vehicle of business, particularly for the service industry or for activities involving professionals, especially in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia, Singapore, etc.

# 4.1.3

The Government has, therefore, permitted the LLP form of business organisations in India with a view to create a facilitating environment for entrepreneurs, service providers and professionals to meet the challenges of global competition. Parliament enacted the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 (LLP Act, 2008), which was notified on January 9, 2009. It came into effect from March 31, 2009. The enabling Rules were notified on April 1, 2009 and the first LLP was registered on April 2, 2009.

# 4.1.4

An LLP is a form of business entity, which allows individual partners to be protected from the joint and several liabilities of partners in a partnership firm. The liability of partners incurred in the normal course of business does not extend to the personal assets of the partners. It is capable of entering into contracts and holding property in its own name. An LLP would be able to fulfill the compliance norms with much greater ease, coupled with limitation of liability. The corporate structure of LLP and the statutory disclosure requirements would enable higher access to credit in the market. The introduction of LLP form of business is expected to promote entrepreneurship, particularly in relation to the knowledge-based industries, such as the information technology and biotechnology sectors, and other service providers and professionals.

# 4.1.5

The functions of Registrar of LLP are being exercised by the RoC, with effect from June 11, 2012. Natural persons and body corporates, Indian or Foreign, can be partners in an LLP. At least two of them must be “Designated Partners”, of which, at least one should be a resident of India. A body corporate can also be a designated partner.

### Page 34

and in such a case, an individual authorized by the body corporate will function as the designated partner. The LLP can continue to have its existence irrespective of changes in partners.

# 4.1.6

An LLP is required to maintain Books of Account and Statement of Account and Solvency which are to be led with the Registrar every year. An LLP can be wound up, either voluntarily, or by an order of NCLT.

# 4.1.7

In order to infuse a culture of transparency, the documents/information such as incorporation document, names of partners and changes, if any, made therein, Statement of Account and Solvency and annual return are open for inspection by any person on payment of a prescribed fee. The Central Government has powers to investigate the affairs of an LLP, if required, by appointing an Inspector.

# 4.1.8

A firm, private company or an unlisted public company, is allowed to be converted into an LLP in accordance with the provisions of the LLP Act, 2008. Provisions have also been made for corporate actions like mergers, amalgamations, etc.

# 4.1.9

In order to enhance and extend operational convenience to stakeholders and grouping of all registry-related functions on a single platform, e-governance initiative for LLP was integrated with MCA21 from June 11, 2012. With this integration, the filing and approval of LLP forms is being done through.

# 4.1.10

An LLP serves as a business vehicle in the body corporate form, having a separate legal entity and a perpetual succession with liability of the partners limited to their agreed contributions.

# 4.1.11

The LLP Act, 2008 was amended through LLP (Amendment) Act, 2021 on August 13, 2021 to ease the regulations in the case of Limited Liability Partnerships, by decriminalization of 12 offences, prescription of standards of accounting and standards of auditing, establishment of Special Courts for speedy trial of offences, and introduction of new concepts such as “Small LLP” under the provisions of the LLP Act, 2008.

# 4.1.12

As part of the Government's constant efforts to promote EoDB, the Ministry has launched an amnesty scheme vide General Circular No. 08/2023 dated 23.08.2023 under which LLP Form-3 and LLP Form-4 are processed under Straight Through Process (STP) mode. Further, filing of Form-11 without additional fee was made applicable for FY 2021-22 onwards.

# 4.1.13

As on March 31, 2024, the number of LLPs registered in the country were 3,61,839 and of them, 3,25,789 LLPs were active.

# THE COMPETITION ACT, 2002 AND RELATED ACTIVITIES

The Competition Act, 2002 and Establishment of the Competition Commission of India (CCI)

# 5.1.1

The Parliament enacted the Competition Act, 2002, with the following objectives:

- (i) to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition;
- (ii) to promote and sustain competition in markets;
- (iii) to protect the interests of consumers; and
- (iv) to ensure freedom of trade carried on by other participants in markets, in India, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

The Competition Act has four pillars, which reinforce one another and are as follows:

- (i) Prohibits anti-competitive agreements like cartels, which restrict freedom of trade and cause consumer harm by way of limiting production and distribution of goods and services and fixing prices higher than normal;
- (ii) Prohibits abusive behaviour of a dominant firm, who through its position of dominance may restrict markets and sets unfair and discriminatory conditions;
- (iii) Regulates combination(s) of large corporations in order to safeguard competitive markets; and
- (iv) Mandates competition advocacy.

# 5.1.2

CCI (hereinafter, also referred to as the Commission) was established in the year 2003 and got its enforcement and regulatory powers after the substantive provisions of the Act relating to anti-trust enforcement and regulation of combinations came into force on May 20, 2009, and June 1, 2011, respectively.

# 5.1.3

The Competition Act, 2002, provides for setting up of the CCI comprising Chairperson and a minimum of two and maximum of six Members. The Union Government in April, 2018 had decided that there would be three members in CCI. Thus, as per revised composition, the Commission consists of one Chairperson and three Members. The Act also provides for establishment of an Appellate Tribunal to hear and dispose of appeals against the orders of CCI and adjudicate upon the claims of compensation that may arise from the findings of the Commission. The work of Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT), in pursuance of the amendment of the Competition Act, 2002 by the Finance Act, 2017, has been merged with NCLAT. As such, the former tribunal has ceased to exist and now all first appeals against the orders of the Commission lie before the NCLAT.

# CHAPTER-VI

# THE INSOLVENCY AND BANKRUPTCY CODE, 2016

# Overview

6.1.1 Economic growth is associated with expanding credit as the demand for financial services increases. Bank credit finances capital formation and increases production and consumption in the economy, further stimulating the economic growth. However, as an economy expands and so does the bank credit, the problem of Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) is also seen to emerge.

Corporate Insolvencies and Liquidations are a common feature of liberal market economies. When certain corporates fail, they are either acquired / merged / amalgamated by competitors or liquidated and their assets are sold to recover creditors' dues. Corporate failures also mean rising NPAs of the banking sector. Banks have to deal with borrowers who are unable to service their debts and therefore, have to employ procedures to take over and realise the collateral. Addressing unsustainable levels of NPAs is the key to preserving financial stability and is an important element of an integrated development agenda of a nation. And so, exit of financially distressed corporate entities is a necessity and it needs to be facilitated in the interest of the economy but subject to maximum re-component of losses to the creditors, both financial and operational.

6.1.2 A sound legal and regulatory framework for resolution of financially distressed companies and a strong secondary market for distressed assets are necessary.

# Erstwhile framework in India

6.2.1 Several attempts were made in the past to provide a legal and institutional machinery for dealing with debt defaults. However, these attempts had not kept pace with the changes in the Indian economy. While provisions for recovery action by creditors were available under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, special laws such as the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 (RDBA) and the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI), they did not yield desired outcomes. Furthermore, action through the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (SICA) and the winding-up provisions under the Companies Act, 1956 (CA-56) were not proving to be very helpful for either recovery by lenders or restructuring of firms. The laws dealing with individual insolvency, namely, the Presidency-Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920, were also archaic and not suitable for the changing needs of the time. This hampered the resolution process.

### Page 41

# 6.3.1

In the backdrop of these rather unsuccessful experiments, the stressed assets in the banking system reached unacceptably high levels by the end of 2015. By September 2016, it reached about 9 per cent of gross loans of all banks and 12 per cent of gross loans of public sector banks, which accounted for more than 80 per cent of total NPAs. On the corporate side, major companies were operating with an interest coverage ratio of less than 1, implying the inability to service debt obligations. Thus, what emerged is popularly referred to as the 'Twin Balance Sheet' problem where the banks were reeling under the stress of bad loans and corporates were unable to service their debt.

# 6.3.2

With time, it was deemed expedient to make the resolution of unviable entities effective, easily accessible and provide for ease of exit for firms. The need for a comprehensive legislation arose eventually, which led to the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC/Code).

# 6.4.1

A Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee (BLRC) was constituted to study the legal framework for corporate bankruptcy in India and based on its recommendations with slight modifications as suggested by Joint Parliamentary Committee in its April 2016 Report. The Code became effective from May 28, 2016.

# Applicability and Ecosystem of the Code

# 6.5.1

The Code provides a legislative framework for the insolvency resolution of (i) Companies under the CA-13, limited liability partnerships under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 or any other person incorporated with limited liability under any law (excluding financial service providers); and (ii) personal guarantors to corporate debtors, partnership firms and proprietorship firms and individuals other than personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The provisions relating to Insolvency Resolution and Liquidation of Corporates and the Personal Guarantors to corporate debtors have been notified till date.

# 6.5.2

Further, the framework for insolvency and liquidation of Financial Service Providers (FSPs) other than Banks have been notified with effect from November 15, 2019.

# 6.5.3

The Code has created a cohesive and comprehensive ecosystem since its enactment in 2016, which cements the processes and the service providers together towards the achievement of its objectives in a time bound manner. The four pillars of the Code are as follows:

- Insolvency Professionals (IPs), who are the regulated and licensed professional, responsible for managing and overseeing the efficient working of the insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy processes.

### Page 42

(ii) Information Utilities (IUs) are regulated and licensed repositories of information who store facts about lenders and terms of lending in electronic database and eliminate delays and disputes about facts when default does take place.

(iii) A d j u d i c a t i n g A u t h o r i t y ( A A ), namely, NCLT acts as the forum where corporate insolvency is heard.
