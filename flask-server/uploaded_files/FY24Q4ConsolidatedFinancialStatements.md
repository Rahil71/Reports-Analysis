         (a)      These adjustments reconcile certain of the Company’s GAAP results of operations to its non-GAAP results of operations. The Company believes that the presentation of results
                  excluding the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that
                  is indicative of the Company’s core operating results and facilitates comparison of operating results across reporting periods. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures
                  when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company’s
                  GAAP results.

         (b)      Non-GAAP adjustments to provision for income taxes and net income to reflect the impact of the reversal of the European General Court’s State Aid decision recognized during
                  the fourth quarter of 2024. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the European General Court and
                  confirmed the European Commission’s 2016 State Aid decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion,
                  net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of restricted funds held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in
                  unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million. For additional information, refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that will be included in
                  Part II, Item 8 of the Company's fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

         (c)      Represents the per-share impact of the non-GAAP adjustments to net income.
