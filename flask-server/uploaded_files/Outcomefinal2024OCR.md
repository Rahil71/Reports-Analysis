During the quarter and year ended March 31, 2024, the Company had re-assessed its tax provision in respect of certain tax credits on income assessed of earlier years, based on the tax assessments and the related provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and has accordingly reversed the tax provision of ₹ 257.21 Crore which is recognized as credit in current tax expense.

On Company's appeal, the Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT), subsequently merged with National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), vide its interim Order dated November 7, 2016, had granted stay against the CCI's Order with the condition to deposit 10% of the penalty amount; which was deposited and further in case the appeal is dismissed, interest at 12% p.a. would be payable on the balance amount from the date of the CCI order. NCLAT vide its Order dated July 25, 2018, dismissed the Company's appeal, and upheld the CCI's order. Against this, the Company appealed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which by its Order dated October 05, 2018, had admitted the appeal and directed to continue the Interim order passed by the NCLAT.

In a separate matter, pursuant to a reference filed by the Government of Haryana, the CCI by its Order dated January 19, 2017, had imposed a penalty of ₹ 35.32 Crore on the Company. On Company's appeal, COMPAT had stayed the operation of the CCI's Order. The matter is pending for hearing before NCLAT.

During the financial year 2022-23, a short seller report ("SSR”) was published in which certain allegations were made on some of the Adani Group Companies. In this regard, certain writ petitions were filed with the Hon'ble Supreme Court ("SC") seeking independent investigation of the allegations in the SSR and the Securities and Exchange Board of India ("SEBI") also commenced investigating the allegations made in the SSR for any violations of applicable SEBI Regulations. In this regard, during financial year 2023-24, SC appointed expert committee concluded its report finding no regulatory failure, in respect of applicable laws and regulations and SC by its order dated 3rd January, 2024, disposed off all matters of appeal relating to the allegations in the SSR (including other allegations) in various petitions including those relating to separate independent investigations. The SEBI also concluded its investigations in twenty-two of the twenty-four matters as per the status report dated 25th August, 2023 to the SC, and later SC directed SEBI to complete pending two investigations and take its investigations (including the twenty-two investigations already completed) to their logical conclusion in accordance with law.

Pursuant to the SC order, various legal and regulatory proceedings by SEBI, legal opinions obtained, independent legal & accounting review undertaken by the Adani group and the fact that there are no pending regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings as of date, the management of the Company concluded that there were no material consequences of the allegations mentioned in the SSR and other allegations on the Company as at year ended March 31, 2024, and accordingly, the results for the year ended March 31, 2024 did not require any adjustments in this regard. There are no changes to the above conclusions as at and of the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of ACC Limited (the "Company") for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the "Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations").

2. The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.

3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
