We continue to be #1 SUV player by revenue and gained 3.5% market share in LCVs < 3.5T category. We also improved our Auto Standalone PBIT margin by 190 bps during this period. In tractors, we achieved a market share of 41.6%, a gain of 40 bps during FY24 and improved our core tractor PBIT margins by 30 bps. Our farm machinery segment continued to have robust revenue growth of 32%.”

Mr. Manoj Bhat, Group Chief Financial Officer, M&M Ltd. said, “Our disciplined capital allocation and sharp focus on operating metrics helped generate record cashflows in FY24. We also repaid debt of 3.1k cr. and delivered RoE of 18.4%. Through these steps, we have built a foundation to support the next phase of our growth.”

3. Net loss on investments measured at fair value through profit or loss for the quarter ended 31st March 2024 amounting to Rs. 88.57 crores has been recognised as Other expenses and net gain of Rs. 1,069.91 crores for the year ended 31st March 2024 has been recognised as Other income in the consolidated financial results. Net loss on investments measured at fair value through profit or loss for the quarter ended 31st March 2024 amounting to Rs 141.79 crores has been recognised as Other expenses and net gain of Rs. 892.97 crores for the year ended 31st March 2024 has been recognised as Other income in the standalone financial results.
4. The Company is both an operating company, primarily having operations in the Automotive and Farm Equipment segments and a holding company with a portfolio of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The Company from the quarter ended 30th June 2023 has updated its segment disclosures and in its standalone results has reported five segments, namely Automotive, Farm Equipment, Auto Investments, Farm Investments and Investments in Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services.

In its consolidated segment disclosures, the Company has reported four segments, namely Automotive, Farm Equipment, Financial Services and Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services. Financial Services is part of the Services vertical but reported separately as it meets the required quantitative threshold for separate reporting. Industrial Businesses and Consumer Services segment comprises all other segments that individually do not meet the threshold for separate reporting.

# Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)

# Mahindra & Mahindra Limited

generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the respective Management and Board of Directors of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated annual financial results that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement; whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated annual financial results by the Management and the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated annual financial results, the respective Management and the Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and the respective Management and Board of Directors of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group of its associates and joint ventures is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial Results

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual financial results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual financial results.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual financial results, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion through a separate report on the complete set of financial statements on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the consolidated annual financial results made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual financial results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

# Independent Auditors Report

To the Board of Directors of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited

# Report on the audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone annual financial results of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") for the year ended 2024, attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 63 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone annual financial results:

- a. are presented in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations in this regard; and
- b. give a true and fair view in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting Standards, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the net profit and other comprehensive income and other financial information for the year ended 31 March 2024.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ("SAs") specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"). Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results section of our report. We are independent of the Company, in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone annual financial results.

# Management's and Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Standalone Annual Financial Results

These standalone annual financial results have been prepared on the basis of the standalone annual financial statements. The Company's Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these standalone annual financial results that give a true and fair view of the net profit/loss and other comprehensive income and other financial information in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the financial statements.

Registered Office: B S R & Co (a partnership firm with Registration No. BA61223) converted into B S R & Co LLP (a Limited Liability Partnership with LLP Registration No. AAB-8181) with effect from October 14, 2013.

# Independent Auditor's Report (Continued)

# Mahindra & Mahindra Limited

The preparation and presentation of the standalone annual financial results that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone annual financial results, the Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Annual Financial Results

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone annual financial results as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone annual financial results.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone annual financial results, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion through a separate report on the complete set of financial statements on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the standalone annual financial results made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone annual financial results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone annual financial results, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone annual financial results represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
